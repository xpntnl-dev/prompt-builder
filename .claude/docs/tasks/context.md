### Investigate missing lojong system prompt - found in WisdomDB [31Oct2025_1134] - git-commit
**Summary:** Committed by xpntnl-dev (1ed3493) - 5 file(s) changed, 423 insertion(s), 0 deletion(s)

**Commit Message:**
```
Investigate missing lojong system prompt - found in WisdomDB

Investigation to locate "You are a wise and compassionate guide..." prompt text:

Analysis steps:
1. Examined get_system_prompt_with_metadata() function logic
2. Confirmed function only queries 4 tables (workflows, prompts, prompt_versions, prompt_sections)
3. Created search queries to scan all text columns across entire database
4. Verified no fallback logic or alternative data sources in function

Key findings:
- Function has no fallback to other tables/sources
- Comprehensive text search across all tables found no matching content
- Analysis revealed prompt data exists in separate WisdomDB database
- get_system_prompt_with_metadata('lojong') pulls from different database

Conclusion:
System prompt content located in WisdomDB, not RVKCAT database.
Next step: Migrate lojong prompt data from WisdomDB to main RVKCAT prompts database.

Investigation artifacts:
- search_prompt_text.sql: Initial targeted search query
- search_all_tables.sql: Extended search across known tables
- search_dynamic_all.sql: Dynamic search of all text columns
- analyze_function.md: Function logic analysis and debugging steps
- debug_lojong.sql: Comprehensive diagnostic queries for lojong workflow
```

### Add podcast configuration management UI with full CRUD operations [31Oct2025_1602] - git-commit
**Summary:** Committed by xpntnl-dev (f3046b5) - 13 file(s) changed, 3236 insertion(s), 0 deletion(s)

**Commit Message:**
```
Add podcast configuration management UI with full CRUD operations

Implemented complete UI for managing podcast generation configurations that will integrate with the Podcastfy pipeline. Configs stored in Supabase can override base settings from my_podcast_config.yaml using deep merge strategy.

## What's New

**Database Schema:**
- Complete Supabase table schema with 22 configuration fields
- JSONB columns for arrays (styles, techniques, dialogue structure)
- Indexes on config_type, is_active, config_name, is_default
- RLS policies and automatic updated_at trigger
- Seed data with 5 preset configurations (tech_startup, music_creative, educational, storytelling, debate)

**UI Pages:**
- List page with card/list view toggle (follows Workflows/Prompts pattern)
- Detail page showing all config sections with badges
- Create page with compact 3-column layout (all fields visible without scrolling)
- Edit page with pre-populated form
- Delete with confirmation modal

**Features:**
- Color-coded config type badges (blue/purple/green/orange/red)
- Active/Inactive status management
- Default config marking per type
- Voice pair display (OpenAI TTS voices)
- Comma-separated array input parsing
- Form validation and error handling
- Breadcrumb navigation

**Configuration Options:**
- Basic: name, type, description
- Branding: podcast name, tagline, language
- Conversation: speaker roles, styles, dialogue structure
- Engagement: creativity level, techniques, custom instructions
- TTS: provider, voices (person1/person2), model, audio format
- Advanced: LLM provider/model overrides, long-form settings

## Integration Pattern

Configs will be queried by n8n workflows and injected into podcast generation payloads:
```
Blog → n8n → Query Supabase → Inject Config → Flask API → Deep Merge → Podcastfy
```

## Testing Notes

Run SQL in Supabase:
1. .claude/docs/tasks/database/QUICK_START.sql (creates table + seeds 5 configs)
2. Navigate to /podcasts/configs to test CRUD operations

## Files Added

**Database:**
- .claude/docs/tasks/database/QUICK_START.sql
- .claude/docs/tasks/database/podcast_configs_schema.sql
- .claude/docs/tasks/database/podcast_configs_seed.sql

**UI:**
- src/routes/podcasts/configs/+page.svelte (list)
- src/routes/podcasts/configs/[id]/+page.svelte (detail)
- src/routes/podcasts/configs/new/+page.svelte (create - 3-column layout)
- src/routes/podcasts/configs/[id]/edit/+page.svelte (edit)
- Plus corresponding +page.server.ts files for each route

**Types:**
- src/lib/types.ts (added PodcastConfig interface)

**Documentation:**
- .claude/docs/tasks/podcast-integration/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

## Next Steps

1. Test UI after running database SQL
2. Update edit page to match new compact 3-column layout
3. Plan n8n Supabase query integration to replace hardcoded inject-podcast-config.js
```


### Implement hierarchical podcast data model with parent-child relationship [31Oct2025_1623] - git-commit
**Summary:** Committed by xpntnl-dev (acbbf1a) - 34 file(s) changed, 7143 insertion(s), 51 deletion(s)

**Commit Message:**
```
Implement hierarchical podcast data model with parent-child relationship

USER FEEDBACK: "ok this is very confusing, prodcasts and configurations,
the hierarchy is not at all clear. we need to see podcasts and
configurations, a to many relationship between podcasts and configurations."

PROBLEM SOLVED:
- Previous flat structure had no clear grouping of configs by podcast
- User couldn't see which configs belonged to which podcast show
- Navigation was confusing (collapsible menu with single "Configs" submenu)

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
Created proper one-to-many relationship:
  Podcasts (parent)
    ├── XPNTNL Insider
    │   ├── zen-revok-content-podcast (config)
    │   └── [future configs...]
    ├── Revok Records Radio
    │   └── revok-records-radio (config)
    └── [other podcasts...]

DATABASE CHANGES:
1. New 'podcasts' parent table
   - podcast_name, podcast_tagline, description
   - brand_color (hex) for visual identification
   - default_output_language, is_active
   - RLS policies, updated_at trigger

2. Updated 'podcast_configs' table
   - Added podcast_id FK → podcasts(id)
   - CASCADE delete (removing podcast removes all its configs)
   - Indexed for performance
   - Kept podcast_name/tagline columns during migration

3. Migration SQL includes:
   - Table creation with constraints
   - 5 parent podcast inserts (from existing config data)
   - Updates to link existing 5 configs to parents
   - Verification query
   - Optional cleanup steps

NEW PAGES (8 files):
Podcasts (parent level):
  - /podcasts → List all podcasts (card/list view)
  - /podcasts/{id} → Podcast detail + all its configs
  - /podcasts/new → Create podcast
  - /podcasts/{id}/edit → Edit podcast

UPDATED CONFIG PAGES (6 files):
  - Create: Accepts ?podcast_id param or shows dropdown
  - Detail/Edit: Load parent podcast, show in breadcrumbs
  - All pages: Updated breadcrumbs (Podcasts → Podcast → Config)

NAVIGATION SIMPLIFIED:
  - Removed collapsible Podcasts menu
  - Simple link: Podcasts → goes to /podcasts list
  - Removed podcastsExpanded store
  - Hierarchy now clear through UI flow

TYPESCRIPT TYPES:
  - Added Podcast interface (9 fields)
  - Updated PodcastConfig interface (added podcast_id FK)

FEATURES:
  - Brand colors display throughout UI
  - Config counts shown on podcast cards
  - Stats summary (total podcasts, active, total configs)
  - Cascade delete with warning modal
  - Podcast selection: pre-filled from parent or dropdown
  - Complete CRUD for both podcasts and configs

NO BREAKING CHANGES:
  - n8n workflows still query podcast_configs table same way
  - Existing configs continue to work
  - Optional: Can drop redundant columns after verification

FILES MODIFIED/CREATED:

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run migration SQL in Supabase Editor:
   .claude/docs/tasks/database/podcasts_hierarchy_schema.sql
2. Test UI: npm run dev → http://localhost:5173/podcasts
3. Verify: Should see 5 podcasts, each with 1 config
4. Optional: Drop redundant columns after verification

TESTING CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Run migration SQL in Supabase
- [ ] List shows 5 podcasts with brand colors

- [ ] Can create/edit/delete podcast
- [ ] Can create config from podcast detail (pre-filled)
